Asynchronous JavaScript helps us to write code that doesn't block the main thread
and allows us to do other things while waiting for a response from the server.

Asynchronous Js helps you to break big tasks into smaller tasks and do them one by one

So using async/await,callbacks and promises we can now form connections with the small steps in
a way that you can get the final result

For example, step to make ice cream
1. Place order  => 2
2. cut the fruit => 2
3. add Water and ice => 1
4. start the machine => 1
5. select the container => 2
6. select the toppings => 3
7. serve the ice cream => 2

// In synchronous way we have to wait for each step to complete before moving to the next step
// In asynchronous way we can do each step at the same time and get the final result
