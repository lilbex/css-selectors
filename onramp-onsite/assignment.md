Assignment 1


Write a function that adds multiple of 3 and 5

Assignment 2

Create a function that returns the sum of the two lowest positive numbers given an array of minimum 4 positive integers. No floats or non-positive integers will be passed.




For example, when an array is passed like [19, 5, 42, 2, 77], the output should be 7.




[10, 343445353, 3453445, 3453545353453] should return 3453455.







Assignment 3

You are required to, given a string, replace every letter with its position in the alphabet.

If anything in the text isn't a letter, ignore it and don't return it.

"a" = 1, "b" = 2, etc.

Example

alphabet_position("The sunset sets at twelve o' clock.")

Should return "20 8 5 19 21 14 19 5 20 19 5 20 19 1 20 20 23 5 12 22 5 15 3 12 15 3 11" ( as a string )
